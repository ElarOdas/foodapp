# Food App

## What is the project for?

This project is a test for my upcoming [master thesis project](). The project builds a
food app using a nginx Gateway, React Frontend, go backend and a postgres database dockerized in a compose structure.
As this is a test project it is intended that only I will use this project.
The goal is to test the implementations of all parts mentioned above starting the actual thesis project.
To achieve this goal I use knowledge from [Stephen Grider's Docker Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/) and [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

## How to install the project?

To start the project you first need to create secrets. Currently a secret generation function is not provided. After generating the secret run the following command.

```bash
docker compose -f compose-dev.yaml up
```

## How to use the project?

The client is accessible on **localhost:3050**. The remaining services are accessible through docker.
The frontend client runs in dev mode as such it is possible to make live changes to the code.

## Testing

Testing is currently not available and not planned. If testing will be included in the future I intend to use
[compose profiles](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md#profiles).
